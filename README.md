About NourishLens

NourishLens is an experimental food-recognition and nutrition-awareness application designed to explore how artificial intelligence can assist users in understanding everyday food choices.

The app uses a camera-based scanning approach to identify food items and provide approximate nutritional information such as calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fats. The focus of NourishLens is not medical accuracy, but concept validation and user interaction with AI-assisted food recognition.                                              
                         
                           
                           How the App Works

The user scans a food item using the device camera.

An AI image-classification model analyzes the captured image.

The app suggests possible food items based on visual similarity.

The user confirms the correct food from the list.

The app displays estimated nutritional values for a typical serving.

If scanning does not work accurately due to lighting, camera limitations, or device restrictions, the user can manually select the food item, ensuring usability in all situations.                               

Current State of the App

NourishLens is currently in its prototype stage.



At this stage:

The app uses a predefined food database.

Nutrition values are approximate and indicative, not exact.

The AI model is used for general recognition, not medical or dietary diagnosis.

The app prioritizes usability, concept clarity, and learning outcomes.

This prototype demonstrates the feasibility and workflow of an AI-powered nutrition assistant rather than claiming complete accuracy.
